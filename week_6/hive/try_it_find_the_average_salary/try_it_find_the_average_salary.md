# Try it: find the average salary

Now try writing a Hive script yourself.

When you click the panel on the right you'll get a terminal connection to a 
server that has Hadoop, YARN, and Hive installed, and has the file 
"employees.csv" in your home directory. You can open the file and inspect its 
contents.

A file called "script.hql" has been created for you. Try adding Hive commands 
to this script, to find the average salary of the employees. You should be able 
to modify commands that you have seen in previous slides.

You can execute your script using the following command:

> $ hive -f script.hql

You should see the commands in your script being executed.

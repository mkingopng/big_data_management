Try it: Find top-k users (CSV data)

In your home directory on this server is a CSV file called "Comments.csv". This dataset is also 
from an anonymized dump of all user-contributed content on the Stack Exchange network. You can 
open the file to inspect its contents. The fields in the file are as follows:

```
- Id
- PostId
- Score
- Text, e.g.: "@Stu Thompson: Seems possible to me"
- CreationDate, e.g.:"2008-09-06T08:07:10.730"
- UserId
```

Your task is to find the top-3 users who have posted the most comments. The output should contain 
the top-3 users with the most comments (represented by UserId) and the number of each userâ€™s 
comments. Please sort the result by the number of comments, and separate the UserId and the number 
of comments by "\t". Your result should be like this format:

```
7 5
5 4
6 3
```

The code template has been given in the file "top3user.py". Think about what is the most efficient 
way of solving this problem.

`cd home`

`spark-submit top3user.py "file:///home/Department.csv"`

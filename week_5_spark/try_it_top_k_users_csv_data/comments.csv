1,2,0,Software recommendations are hard on SE but I could see this being useful to this community.,2017-05-23T14:22:59.063,7
1,2,0,This does not help,2017-05-24:T14:23:59.063,5
2,2,1,very useful. This is a huge concern.,2017-05-23T14:34:40.610,1
3,3,0,To note it there's an [SE for Software Recommendations](https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com).  But I'm not suggesting that this is off-topic since it seems like a helpful type of question.,2017-05-23T14:36:16.600,9
4,2,0,I agree that this question can be problematic for SE but it is also extremely important.  How do other SEs deal with such list-format questions?  Surely there must be some mechanism on [matheducators](https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/).,2017-05-23T14:36:25.217,6
5,10,2,I do like the idea of injecting a little bit of project management into the assignment. That's also an interesting note about there possibly being value in testing their ability to spot people not contributing.,2017-05-23T14:36:42.540,7
6,2,0,_@Choirbean This is how most sites handle it: [Meta Math Educators](https://matheducators.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/101/books-and-materials-recommendations). They typically say focused but have their own cultural way of determining what focused means.,2017-05-23T14:50:08.280,7
7,10,2,_@Adam That sounds like the start of an interesting answer.,2017-05-23T14:53:11.240,7
8,14,1,any specific context? college? high school? etc?,2017-05-23T14:53:35.080,5
9,2,0,I am wary of making the site too US-centric.  Is there a better way to designate this?,2017-05-23T14:54:54.023,8
10,14,0,Are you taking this test on a computer?,2017-05-23T14:55:14.497,3
11,14,0,Not tests this is regarding lab assignments,2017-05-23T14:56:29.907,5
12,1,0,maybe just state the age range? i.e. 15-18 or whatever your age range is,2017-05-23T14:56:54.707,5
13,7,1,would you consider flowcharts (like if/else flows) as a flavor or pseudo-code?,2017-05-23T14:57:12.293,2
14,14,0,_@Choirbean Can you care to expand on what you mean about labs. Like cheating off of other students?,2017-05-23T14:57:24.140,6
15,14,0,A more specific example will make for an easier to answer question. Particularly in the closed beta it's very easy to jump in with over-generalised questions rather than relating the question to a specific example.,2017-05-23T15:01:53.160,1
16,17,0,Do you have any specific language you are using?,2017-05-23T15:02:26.913,6
17,3,7,This is language agnostic I'm really looking forward to ways for students to grasp the concept of recusion,2017-05-23T15:03:14.630,8
18,6,0,I am a student can you give me an example?,2017-05-23T15:05:51.840,7
19,7,2,It seems to me that you need some programming language to actually run things and test ideas.  It is one thing to understand what makes something work and another to actually execute it.,2017-05-23T15:07:37.473,4
20,17,0,How about [Fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)?,2017-05-23T15:08:45.480,10

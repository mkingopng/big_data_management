# Part B - Spark SQL with CSV (2 marks)

In Part B your task is to answer a question about the data in a CSV file using 
Spark DataFrames and SQL. When you click the panel on the right you'll get a 
connection to a server that has, in your home directory, the CSV file 
"orders.csv". It's one that you've seen before. Here are the fields in the 
file:

```
OrderDate (date)
ISBN (string)
Title (string)
Category (string)
PriceEach (decimal)
Quantity (integer)
FirstName (string)
LastName (string)
City (string)
```

Your task is to find the number of books ordered each day, sorted by the number 
of books descending, then order date ascending.

Your results should appear as the following:

```
2009-04-03,10
2009-04-02,8
2009-04-01,7
2009-04-04,6
2009-03-31,5
2009-04-05,4
2009-04-08,4
```

Write a Python program that uses Spark DataFrames and SQL to do this. A file 
called "sql.py" has been created for you - you just need to fill in the 
details. Again, you should be able to modify programs that you have already 
seen in this week's content. 

You can test your program by running the following command:

`$ spark-submit sql.py`

Please save your results in the 'result-sql' folder in HDFS. When you are 
happy that your program is correct, click "Submit".

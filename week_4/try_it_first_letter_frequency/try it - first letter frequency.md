# Try it: first letter frequency
Try writing a job that counts **the frequencies of word first letters** in a file. That is, for each letter of the 
alphabet (a-z) it counts the number of words that start with that letter. Let's ignore letter case, so that 'a' and 
'A' count as the same letter.

A file "job.py" has been started for you. You just need to fill in the details.

The file text.txt is also on the server. You can run your job using text.txt as the input using the following command:

`python job.py text.txt`

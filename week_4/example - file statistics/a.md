# Example: file statistics
It will be helpful to go through some more examples.

When you click the panel on the right you'll get a connection to a server that has the file "text.txt" in your home 
directory.

There is also a MRJob program that calculates some basic statistics about a file: the number of lines, the number of 
words, and the number of characters. Read through the program and make sure you understand how it works.

You can run the program on the text file by typing the following command into the terminal:

```$ python job.py text.txt```
